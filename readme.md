# Spotify recently listened albums app
This app aims to create a website that summarizes the albums the user has recently listened to. The app checks the users status every 10 minutes and if a new album is being listened to it saves the album reference. 

When visiting the website, the user will be able to see the albums in a grid and will be able to download all the album covers on a single image.
